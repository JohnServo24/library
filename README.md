# library

--- TO ADD:
* Checks if the book exists (WILL ADD LATER BECAUSE I HAVENT LEARNED ASYNC/PROMISES YET)
* Store book locally (WILL DO LATER BECAUSE I HAVENT LEARNED JSON YET)
* Add a unique identification for each book since if we have two books of the same name but w/ different authors and we delete one of them, it deletes every book in the library with the same name regardless of the author
* Make the items on the library unclickable when sidebar is active
